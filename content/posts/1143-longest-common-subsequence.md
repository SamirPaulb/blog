<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/">1143. Longest Common Subsequence</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>Given two strings <code>text1</code> and <code>text2</code>, return <em>the length of their longest <strong>common subsequence</strong>. </em>If there is no <strong>common subsequence</strong>, return <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>A <strong>subsequence</strong> of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For example, <code>"ace"</code> is a subsequence of <code>"abcde"</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <strong>common subsequence</strong> of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
<strong>Output:</strong> 3  
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= text1.length, text2.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>text1</code> and <code>text2</code> consist of only lowercase English characters.</li>
</ul>
</div>

class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        x = text1
        y = text2
        
        dp = [[0]*(len(y)+1) for i in range(len(x)+1)]
        
        for i in range(1, len(x)+1):
            for j in range(1, len(y)+1):
                if x[i-1] == y[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
        
        return dp[-1][-1]
